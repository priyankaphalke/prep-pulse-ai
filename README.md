https://prep-pulse-ai.lovable.app

Prep AI Interview is an AI-powered mock interview platform designed to help candidates practice interviews in a realistic, structured, and feedback-driven way.

The project simulates real interview scenarios, asks role-specific questions, evaluates responses, and provides actionable feedback to improve interview performance.

## ❓ Problem

Many candidates struggle with interviews due to:
- Lack of realistic interview practice
- No structured feedback on answers
- Anxiety and low confidence
- Limited access to quality mock interviews

Traditional preparation methods are passive and do not replicate real interview pressure.

---

## 🎯 Solution

Prep AI Interview acts as a **virtual AI interviewer** that:

1. Conducts mock interviews based on role and difficulty  
2. Asks contextual and progressive interview questions  
3. Evaluates candidate responses  
4. Provides feedback on clarity, relevance, and confidence  
5. Helps candidates identify strengths and improvement areas  

The focus is on **practice, feedback, and confidence-building**.
